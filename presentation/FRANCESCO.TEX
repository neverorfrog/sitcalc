\subsection{Introduction}

\begin{frame}{Outline}
    Situation calculus provides a framework for reasoning about actions.

    This work presents an expansion to handle the \textit{knowledge} possessed or acquired by the agent,
    and allow it to shape the agent's decisions.
    \begin{itemize}%[<+->]
        \item Knowledge is represented by one additional fluent
        \item Uniform axiomatization with the rest of sitcalc
        \item Ordinary actions and knowledge-producing ones are strictly separated
        \item Easy expansion of regression as defined in [Reiter2001]
        \item Desirable properties are direct consequences of the axiomatization \\
                (e.g. knowledge persistence / memory)
    \end{itemize}

\subsection{Knowledge as a fluent}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{The K fluent}
    \huge
    \[ \sck(s', s) \]
    \normalsize

    Defines an accessibility relation between situations.

    \begin{block}{(Informal) definition}
        \( \sck(s',s) \) is true if an agent in situation \(s\)
        could mistake the current situation for the other \(s'\),
        given its current knowledge.
    \end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Knowledge}
    \begin{block}{Definition of knowledge}
        A fluent is known to be true (false) in a situation \(s\)
        if and only if it is true (false)
        in all situations accessible from \(s\).
    \end{block}

    Shorthand notation: \( \knows(\phi, s) \defeq \forall s' \: \sck(s',s) \rightarrow \phi(s') \)
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Knowledge-producing actions}
    Actions that have an effect on the agent's knowledge

    \begin{block}{SENSE actions}
        Learn the truth value of a formula. Example: check if a door is open or closed.
        \[
            \knows(\scp, \scdo(\scsense_{\scp}, s))
            \lor
            \knows(\lnot \scp, \scdo(\scsense_{\scp}, s))
        \]
    \end{block}

    \begin{block}{READ actions}
        Learn the value of a term. Example: read a number on a sheet of paper.
        \[
            \exists x \: \knows(\tau = x, \scdo(\scread_\tau, s))
        \]
    \end{block}

    \emph{Assumption: ordinary and knowledge-producing actions are strictly separated.}
\end{frame}

\subsection{Defining a successor state axiom for K}

\begin{frame}{Knowledge effects}
    In order to complete the specification of the \sck{} fluent,
    we need to define its successor state axiom,
    determining how ordinary actions and knowledge-producing actions affect it.

    Consider this case study with three accessible situations. The agent is in S1.

    \begin{center}
        \includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{assets/3states_noactions.png}
    \end{center}

    \[ \knows(\scp, S1) \land \lnot \knows(\scq, S1) \]
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Ordinary actions}
    Assume the agent performs a \textfluent{drop} action.

    \begin{block}{Informal idea}
        The agent cannot distinguish the current situation \(s\) from all the other
        \(s'\) accessible from it. Therefore, after executing the action,
        the agent may believe to be in any situation resulting from any \(s'\) after executing \textfluent{drop}.
    \end{block}

    \begin{block}{Axiomatization}
        \[ \sck(s'', \scdo(\scdrop, s)) \equiv \exists s' \: (\scposs(\scdrop, s') \land \sck(s',s) \land s'' = \scdo(\scdrop, s')) \]
    \end{block}
\end{frame}

% \begin{frame}{Ordinary actions}
%     This axiomatization makes it so that the situations resulting from the \scdrop{} action
%     are connected in the same way as the original ones.

%     The only knowledge gained is that the \scdrop{} action has been performed, as well as
%     anything that can be derived from the action effects. For example, if \scdrop{}
%     makes \scp false:

%     \[ \scp(\scdo(a,s)) \equiv a \not = \scdrop \land \scp(s) \]

%     then

%     \[ \knows(\lnot \scp, \scdo(\scdrop, S1)) \]

%     but no extra knowledge is gained about \scq.

            as well as anything that can be derived from the action effects.
            
            For example, if \scdrop{} makes \scp false:

            \[ \scp(\scdo(a,s)) \equiv a \not = \scdrop \land \scp(s) \]

            then

            \[ \knows(\lnot \scp, \scdo(\scdrop, S1)) \]

            but no extra knowledge is gained about \scq.
